    <description>
      WhiteboxTools is an advanced geospatial software package and a data analysis platform developed at the University of Guelphâ€™s Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group (GHRG). The project began in January 2017 and quickly evolved in terms of its analytical capabilities. Some of WhiteboxTools features include:

      * Contains more than 450 tools for processing various types of geospatial data
      * Many tools operate in parallel, taking full advantage of your multi-core processor.
      * Written in the safe and cross-platform systems programming language Rust and compiled to highly efficient native code. No virtual machine or interpreter required is needed to run WhiteboxTools.
      * Small stand-alone application with no external dependencies, making installation as easy as downloading the small zip file and decompressing it.
      * Simple yet powerful Python scripting interface that allows users to develop custom scripted workflows
      * Embed WhiteboxTools functions into hetergeneous scripting environments along with ArcPy, GDAL, and other geoprocessing libraries.
      * Serves as an analytical back-end for other GIS, remote sensing, and geospatial software (e.g. the QGIS Whitebox for Processing plugin). See more on the many front-ends developed for WhiteboxTools here.
      * Permissive MIT open-source license allows for ready integration with other software.
